# Assembly Snake

Just the game snake on the terminal that i made for the Logical Circuits exam.
It was made for DOS, but i wanted to run it on a linux terminal, so i converted it by changing the interrupts of dos with linux's syscalls.

## I still need to convert some code and make the Dockerfile... (WIP)
